# PBR with HOOPS Communicator

This is a simple viewer application that demonstrates the Physically Based Rendering (PBR) capabilities of HOOPS Communicator.

To run this demo, launch index.html using a tool such as [VS Code Live Server Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) or the Node.js [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).

Physically Based Rendering is a method of rendering that simulates how light and materials interact in the natural world.

HOOPS Communicator supports the import and editing of many PBR properties such as:

- Base Color: the color of a model.
- Metallic: whether an entity is a metal or dielectric.
- Roughness: the surface roughness of an entity.
- Ambient Occlusion: soft shadows cast upon an entity.
- Opacity (Alpha): transparency of an entity.
- Textures: including emissive, normals, etc.
- Image Based Lighting: lighting cast by an image/scene.
